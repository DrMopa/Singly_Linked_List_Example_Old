# Singly_Linked_List_Example_Old
A singly Linked List example using C++ Pointer Structure.

This project is from my early days at university, with that in mind, the efficiency in the code is lacking, however the list is fully functional.

There is no means to read/write data for permanent use, nor is there any real form of error detection/correction. 

The list consists of “Puppets that are Boyfriend material” This was a light hearted joke I played on my teacher at the time.
